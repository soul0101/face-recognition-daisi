# Face Recognition Daisi
This Daisi brings all the essential face recognition features in a simple and reusable format. <br>
Since the python library 'face_recognition' depends on dlib which is written in C++, it can be tricky to deploy an app using it to a cloud hosting providers like Heroku or AWS.
The daisi solves the above problem and provides rich features such as: <br>

1) Face detection with bounding box locations
2) Facial landmark detection
3) Extract 128-dimensional face encodings from an image
4) Detect if given face encoding exists in the image (Facial recognition)
5) Face similarity index
6) Face Authentication and Recognition
